Ingredients:
- 1½-2 cups peeled and shredded Beets
- 1 cup peeled and shredded carrots or parsnips (I only had parsnips so I used those instead of carrots)
- 1 cup peeled and shredded sweet potato
- 1 Zucchini, shredded
- 1 shallot, minced
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- Ground Pepper
- ¼ cup water
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil (for skillet)

Directions:
  1. Shred the beets, carrots/parsnips, sweet potato, zucchini and the shallot and add into a large bowl. (I suggest shredding the beets last as they are quite messy and make you look like you've just offed someone)
  2. Next, add in the flour, cornstarch and the black pepper. Mix and then add in the water and mix again, making sure that everything is blended together.
  3. Heat a non-stick skillet with a bit of olive oil on medium heat. I used a ¼ cup measuring cup to scoop equal parts of the mixture, and then I plopped the latkes onto the skillet and flattened them slightly with a flat turner/flipper (not sure exactly what those things are called :[)
  4. Fry for about 5-6 minutes and then flip over and fry for another 4-5 minutes.k
